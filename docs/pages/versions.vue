        This was the first release of the Design System, with documentation written in a Nuxt-based statically-generated site. The focus was on migrating components out of the Kolibri and making them reusable in a shared component library.

        The design system was originally based on a set of internal Kolibri components and their use as documented in the Kolibri Style Guide, which was first introduced into the Kolibri code base <DocsExternalLink text="in version 0.6" href="https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/tree/release-v0.6.x/kolibri/plugins/style_guide" />. This remained until <DocsExternalLink text="version 0.13" href="https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri/tree/release-v0.13.x/kolibri/plugins/style_guide" /> after which the content was migrated here.
